DuckSightings is a small frontend app for [Duck backend](https://github.com/vincit/summer-2018). This small project is part of summer job application for [Vincit](https://www.vincit.fi/)

Live version can be found [here](https://vincit-duck-sighting.herokuapp.com/). This repository's latest commit is making calls to [Duck backend](https://github.com/vincit/summer-2018) which is running on seperate Heroku instance [here](https://duck-server.herokuapp.com/).

## Requirements

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed with npm.

## Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/okkimus/DuckSightings.git
$ cd DuckSightings
$ npm install
```

## Run

NOTE: this is just a frontend application for [Duck backend](https://github.com/vincit/summer-2018). If you wish to use the backend, you need to clone and run that server aswell. Current code is making calls to deployed backend server, so you might want to change that before running.

To start server run

```
$ npm start
```
